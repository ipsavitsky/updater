#+title: Automatically update all system dependencies

* Does it work?
This script is for updating my current Ubuntu setup - it is very personalized and makes a few assumptions
- Only the following generic package managers are used:
  - Apt
  - Nix (as a profile manager)
  - Flatpak
- Go binaries are installed with ~go~ and updated with [[https://github.com/nao1215/gup][~gup~]]
- Rust is installed with ~rustup~
- Rust binaries are installed with ~cargo~ and updated with [[https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update][~cargo install-update~]]
- Python programs are installed with [[https://github.com/pypa/pipx][~pipx~]]
- Javascript programs are installed with [[https://bun.sh/][~bun~]]
- Haskell is installed with ~ghcup~
- Haskell binaries are managed through ~cabal~
- Emacs uses ~doom~
* Dependencies
- nix
- flatpak
- rustup
- ghcup
- go
- gup
- pipx
- bun
- emacs + doom
* Todo
- Figure something up to speed up cabal install
- Automatically install new go versions
